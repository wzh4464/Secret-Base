# Ratio Analysis
- activity ratio
- liquidity ratio
- solvency ratio
- profitability ratio
## Activity Ratio
- Inventory Turnover: COGS/Average Inventory
- Receivable Turnover: Net Revenue/Average Receivable
- Payable Turnover: Purchases/Average Payable
$$
\text{Operating Cycle} = \text{Collection Period} + \text{Inventory Period}
\text{Cash Conversion Cycle} = \text{Operating Cycle} - \text{Payment Period}
$$
![Period 之间关系](2024-02-14_11-52-49.jpg)
- DPO (Days Payable Outstanding): Accounts Payable / COGS * 365
- DSO (Days Sales Outstanding): Accounts Receivable / Net Revenue * 365
- DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding): Inventory / COGS * 365
- CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle): DSO + DIO - DPO
- OC (Operating Cycle): DSO + DIO
Note: Revenue is recognized when the goods are shipped. So the DSO is calculated based on the revenue, not the received cash.

## Liquidity Ratio
- Current Ratio: Current Asset/Current Liability
- Quick Ratio: (Current Asset - Inventory)/Current Liability 因为 Inventory 不易变现，所以不算在 Quick Ratio 里面
- Cash Ratio: (Cash + Marketable Securities)/Current Liability 几天内能偿还债务，从Quick Ratio 到 Cash Ratio 刨除了 Receivable
- Defensive Interval (Days): (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivable)/average Daily Operating Expense
## Solvency Ratio
也叫杠杆比率
- Debt ratio:
| Ratio | Numerator | Denominator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debt-to-assets | Total Debt | Total Asset |
| Debt-to-capital  <span style="color:red"> 刨去免费融资，比如应付货款 </span> | Total Debt | Total Debt + Total Equity <span style="color:red"> debt 指的是 interest-bearing debt </span> |
| Debt-to-equity <span style="color:red"> 杠杆，自有资金撬动多少外部资金 </span>| Total Debt | Total Equity |
| Financial Leverage | Average Total Asset | Average Total Equity |
- Coverage ratio:
| Ratio | Numerator | Denominator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest Coverage | EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax) | Interest Expense |
| Fixed Charge Coverage | EBIT + Lease Payment | Interest Expense + Lease Payment |
> Lease Payment 是租赁费用，因为租赁费用是固定的，所以要加到 EBIT 里面
## Profitability Ratio
- Gross Margin: Gross Profit/Net Revenue
- Operating profit margin: EBIT/Net Revenue
- Pre-tax margin: EBT/Net Revenue
- Net profit margin: Net Income/Net Revenue
- Return on Asset (ROA): Net Income/Average Total Asset
- Return on Equity (ROE): Net Income/Average Total Equity <span style="color:red"> 1块钱资产能赚多少净利润 </span>
- Return on total capital: EBIT/Average Total Capital <span style="color:red"> EBIT 除以总资本 </span>
