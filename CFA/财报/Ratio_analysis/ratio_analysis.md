## Liquidity Ratio

- Current Ratio: Current Asset/Current Liability
- Quick Ratio: (Current Asset - Inventory)/Current Liability 因为 Inventory 不易变现，所以不算在 Quick Ratio 里面
- Cash Ratio: (Cash + Marketable Securities)/Current Liability 几天内能偿还债务，从Quick Ratio 到 Cash Ratio 刨除了 Receivable
- Defensive Interval (Days): (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivable)/average Daily Operating Expense

## Solvency Ratio

也叫杠杆比率

- Debt ratio:

| Ratio | Numerator | Denominator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debt-to-assets | Total Debt | Total Asset |
| Debt-to-capital  <span style="color:red"> 刨去免费融资，比如应付货款 </span> | Total Debt | Total Debt + Total Equity <span style="color:red"> debt 指的是 interest-bearing debt </span> |
| Debt-to-equity <span style="color:red"> 杠杆，自有资金撬动多少外部资金 </span>| Total Debt | Total Equity |
| Financial Leverage | Average Total Asset | Average Total Equity |

- Coverage ratio:

| Ratio | Numerator | Denominator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest Coverage | EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax) | Interest Expense |
| Fixed Charge Coverage | EBIT + Lease Payment | Interest Expense + Lease Payment |

> Lease Payment 是租赁费用，因为租赁费用是固定的，所以要加到 EBIT 里面

## Profitability Ratio

- Gross Margin: Gross Profit/Net Revenue
- Operating profit margin: EBIT/Net Revenue
- Pre-tax margin: EBT/Net Revenue
- Net profit margin: Net Income/Net Revenue
- Return on Asset (ROA): Net Income/Average Total Asset
- Return on Equity (ROE): Net Income/Average Total Equity
- Return on total capital: EBIT/Average Total Capital <span style="color:red"> EBIT 除以总资本 </span>
